## The dataset i choose to work on is building invetory data set which was choosen from my IS 445 class week 6. The data details the information about the buildings in and around illinois state.


## The data set mainly measures the year acquires, congress dist, square footage, number of floors, city name, buildings name. It details all the buildings in and or illinois state detailed. But however in my above chart i measure the year acquired with square fooatge. Which details the sum of square footage in particular year. This way we can see the trend of grwoing or decereasing buildings in illinois. In order to show my analysis i choose to use vegalite line mark with tootltip which will is easy to read the data in detailed when hovered over it.
